export const TECH_CHANNEL_INTRO = "Since May 2023, my channel has garnered <strong>4,300+ subscribers</strong> and over <strong>200k views</strong>. Focusing in computer science and software engineering, I cover tech stack intros (React, Kotlin), share insights from internships (agile development, pair programming, best coding practices), and recommend study resources (full-stack web design, algorithms, etc). The driving force behind my channel is a sincere desire to assist fellow computer science peers in navigating their learning paths. Having experienced the challenges of transitioning from a different major, I aim to share the insights and tips I wish I had received when I first started my CS journey. My goal is to support others who may feel as lost as I once did in the vast world of computer science education. <p>(Yes I started college as a Mechanical Engineering major LOL)</p>"
